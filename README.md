# stabplot

`stabplot` is an R package designed to facilitate regularization tuning and convergence monitoring in stability selection using LASSO. It provides two core functions, `Regustab` and `Convstab`, which help visualize stability in regularized models, supporting users in selecting appropriate regularization parameters and assessing convergence.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of `stabplot` from GitHub:

```r
